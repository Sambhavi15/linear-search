# linear-search



Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the 
desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.
Linear search can be used irrespective of whether the array is sorted or not. It can be used on arrays of any data type.it does not require any additional memory.
It is a well suited algorithm for small datasets.

LinearSearch(array, key)

for each item in the array
  
 if item == value
    
 return its index
